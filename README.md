# SmartThings Public GitHub Repo

Forked a repository that allows for connection of Nest thermostats to the Samsung Smartthings z-wave and zigbee hub (My home automation controller). Forking the existing repository allowed me to activate and utilize this code under my personal Smartthings account. Unfortunately, after a recent aquisition of Nest, this implementation is no longer functional. 

This fork is now archived.
